In general, *NiPreps* embrace a [*liberal contribution model*](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/#what-are-some-of-the-common-governance-structures-for-open-source-projects)
of governance structure.
However, because of the scientific domain of *NiPreps*, the community features some
structure from *meritocracy models* to prescribe the order in the
authors list of [new papers about these tools](CONTRIBUTING.md#publications).

## Historical note

The sections below provide a note on how contributions to the *NiPreps*
projects were historically acknowledged.
The scheme below has been substituted by a robuster strategy
that is described in the [contributor recognition](CONTRIBUTING.md#recognizing-contributions)
section.

### Developers

Developers are members of a wonderful team _driving the project_.
Names and contacts of all developers are included in the
[`.maint/MAINTAINERS.md` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/MAINTAINERS.md) of each project.
Examples of steering activities that _drive the project_ are: actively participating in the
follow-up meetings, leading documentation sprints, helping in the design of the tool and definition of the roadmap,
providing resources (in the broad sense, including funding), code-review, etc.

### Contributors

Contributors enlisted in the
[`.maint/CONTRIBUTORS.md` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/CONTRIBUTORS.md) of each project
actively help or have previously helped the project in a broad sense: writing code, writing documentation,
benchmarking modules of the tool, proposing new features, helping improve the scientific
rigor of implementations, giving out support on the different communication
channels (mattermost, [NeuroStars][link_neurostars], GitHub, etc.).
If you are new to the project, don't forget to add your name and affiliation to the list
of contributors there!
Our Welcome Bot will send an automated message reminding this to first-time contributors.
Before every release, unlisted contributors will be invited again to add their names to the file
(just in case they missed the automated message from our Welcome Bot).

Contributors who have contributed at some point to the project but were required or they wished to
disconnect from the project's updates and to drop-out from publications and other dissemination activities,
are listed in the [`.maint/FORMER.md` file](https://github.com/nipreps/fmriprep/blob/master/.maint/FORMER.md).
