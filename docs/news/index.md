# News and Announcements

## PETPrep sprint <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> Aug 18-19, 2025</span>

Several researchers across Europe and North America convened online to
drive forward the development of [*PETPrep*](https://github.com/nipreps/petprep/).
Efforts focused on enhancing documentation and continuous integration
infrastructure, automating packaging and release workflows, and setting
up containerized environments.
This work allowed us to merge 23 pull requests and to open another 9,
and to publish the first alpha release to
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/petprep/0.0.1a0/).

## NSC election result <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> Aug 5, 2025</span>

Following our recent call to extend the NiPreps Steering Committee
(NSC) from three to five members, we are pleased to announce that
**Eilidh MacNicol** and **Guiomar Niso** have been appointed to occupy
the new NSC seats.

Eilidh has played a key role in the development of the fMRIPrep
extension to rodent data, and plans for generalizing the NiPreps tools
to non-human data.

Guiomar has been an active contributor to the NiPreps ecosystem through
repeated participation in our hackathons and community discussions.
Notably, her plans to support the extension of NiPreps tools toward EEG
and MEG aligns with our long-term vision for modality convergence.

We are also sensitive to the fact that the original NSC consisted of
three male members, and are pleased that this appointment contributes
to building a more sex-balanced leadership team.

We are **deeply grateful to all nominees** for their commitment and
thoughtful applications.
**In particular**, we want to recognize **Steven Meisler** and 
**Jon Haitz Legarreta** for their commitment and instrumental contributions
to the NiPreps tools.

## NSC call for new seat election <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> May 21, 2025</span>

With the growth of the NiPreps community, the current NSC has
considered that increasing the number of seats from 3 to 5 is
necessary.
Thus, a call for nominations was made through [this
announcement](https://github.com/nipreps/GOVERNANCE/issues/47).

## NiFreeze receives best poster award at the ISMRM 2025 Diffusion Study Group meeting <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> May 16, 2025</span>

The [*NiFreeze* abstract](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/gfny9_v2) submitted to the [ISMRM 2025 Annual Meeting](https://www.ismrm.org/25m/)
was among the featured abstracts at the ISMRM 2025 Diffusion Study Group
meeting. It received the best [poster award in the *Methods* category](https://x.com/DiffusionISMRM/status/1926200224860475571/photo/1).

## NiPreps hackathon 2025 @ McGovern Institute for Brain Research <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> May 5, 2025</span>

Building on the success of the 2024, the *NiPreppers* gathered again
virtually and in-person at the McGovern Institute for Brain Research in
Cambridge (MA, USA) to hold another [3-day hackathon](https://www.nipreps.org/202504-sprint/).

*NiPost* and fMRI infant/rodent extensions were among the projects that
assembled most contributors.

## NiPreps hackathon 2024 @ McGovern Institute for Brain Research <span style="color: grey; font-size: 72%; position: relative; right: -10px;"> May 20, 2024</span>

The NiPreps community gathered both virtually and in-person at the McGovern
Institute for Brain Research in Cambridge (MA, USA) to hold a
[3-day hackathon](https://www.nipreps.org/202405-sprint/).

Several NiPreps projects received relevant improvements and bug fixes, and
extensive discussions about the *NiTransforms* component were held during the
event.
