# News and Announcements
## Register for the NiPreps hackathon with the OHBM'23 Brainhack!

**We are thrilled to announce that the NiPreps Hackathon's second edition will be part of the upcoming OHBM'23 Brainhack** (July 19-21, Maison Notman House, Montreal, Canada).

**Registration**

**Approach and projects**
We will advance (online) some projects as much as possible before the BrainHack. We are putting together a list of potential projects at https://github.com/orgs/nipreps/projects/8. Please feel free to let us know your ideas and voice your questions. Projects can start at any moment (even at the venue in Montreal) to have the flexibility to accommodate all ideas.

Those projects with preliminary work will have project leaders who will organize meetings, coordinate a roadmap and help carry out the necessary tasks.

See you in Montreal!
